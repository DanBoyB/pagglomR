# `pagglomR`

A package for calculating the agglomeration impacts of transport projects in 
Ireland.

This package is developed in the `R` programming language and requires an
installation of `R`. A guide to installing `R` is available from
<https://cran.r-project.org/>. We would recommend the use of the 
[RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) when using R.


To install this package use the command 
`remotes::install_github("TII-STP/pagglomR")`. This will install the development
version. A stable version will be uploaded to CRAN in due course.
