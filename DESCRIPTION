Description: This package takes outputs from a transport model and calculates 
    the agglomeration impacts based on the methodology of TII PAG Unit 6.9 - 
    Wider Impacts (PE-PAG-02028). This package was developed for use on Irish 
    national road projects but can also be used to assess impacts of Irish 
    public transport projects.
